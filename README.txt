Basic Facts
  Matches Folder = where the match files will be generated
  Match Files will be named like: Matches 3-22-2024 8:58:8.csv
    Generated 3/22/24 at 8:58 am 
    Uses military time (1pm = 13, 2pm = 14, ect)
  Old CSV
    Creates copy of SORTME.csv each time it runs 
    Files will be named like SORTME 3-22-2024 8:58:8.csv
      Time will be same as corresponding match file
    This means you can delete SORTME.csv from outer folder after running
